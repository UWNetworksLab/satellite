Satellite: Mapping the Internet's Stars
=======================================

Satellite is an open platform for measuring the accessibility and presence of
websites on a regular basis. It consists of a zmap-based probing engine for both
HTTP and DNS requests, an aggregation pipeline for data processing, and a web
interface for interactive visualization.

Through this process we attempt to answer the high level question:
How much of the global view of a remote domain can we understand from a
single measurement machine?

We release the data we have collected using this platform at [scans.io](https://scans.io/study/washington-dns).

### How does Satellite Work? ###

The top level functions of satellite are documented in the `fullrun.sh` file,
which is generally scheduled as a cron. job. This script manages the following
process:

* Determine the list of domains of interest. Currently based off of the Alexa top 10,000 list.
* Determine the list of servers of interest. Uses zmap to scan all ipv4 addresses on port 53,
  and a filtering process to extract a diverse and stable set of servers to use for subsequent
  interactions.
* Query servers for domains of interest. A managed set of zmap runs. HTTP scans use a direct
  zmap query, while for efficiency the DNS scans use the custom [udp_multi](https://github.com/willscott/zmap/blob/dns_udp/src/probe_modules/module_udp_multi.c) zmap probing module.
* Aggregate results into more managable forms. Our initial aggregation converts from the raw
  packets received from remote hosts to the list of acceptable IPs seen from different remote
  machines. This produces a file that is much more amenable to further analysis.
* File management: Archiving retrieved data, performing backups, keeping a clean workspace.

### Installation ###

* Install [zmap](https://zmap.io/), and [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/)
* git clone
* npm install

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Attempt to pass jslint as specified by the [brackets](https://brackets.io) editor.
* Comments should go in a branch or fork and then be pull requested for review.
